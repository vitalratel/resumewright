# ResumeWright

**A privacy-first browser extension that converts Claude-generated CV/resume TSX components into professional, ATS-compatible PDF files.**

ResumeWright combines a high-performance Rust/WebAssembly core engine with a TypeScript-based browser extension interface to deliver seamless, local-only CV conversion directly in your browser.

**Status:** Beta - Ready for testing and feedback

---

## Features

✅ **Manual TSX File Import** - Import TSX files generated by Claude.ai from your file system
✅ **High-Performance PDF Generation** - Rust/WASM core converts TSX to professional PDFs
✅ **Privacy-First Architecture** - 100% client-side processing, no data leaves your browser
✅ **Customizable Margins & Paper Sizes** - A4, Letter, Legal with adjustable margins
✅ **Local-Only Storage** - Settings stored in browser (no cloud sync)

**How it works:** Save your Claude-generated TSX code to a `.tsx` file, then use ResumeWright to convert it to a professional PDF. No direct Claude.ai integration - keeps the tool simple, secure, and privacy-focused.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React browser extension (Manifest V3) built with WXT
- **Backend**: Rust/WASM engine for PDF generation
- **Storage**: Local-only (browser storage API, no cloud sync)
- **Build System**: pnpm workspaces + Cargo workspaces (monorepo)

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs-public/ARCHITECTURE.md).
