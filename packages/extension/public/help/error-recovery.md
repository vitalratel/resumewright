## Preventing Future Errors

### Best Practices

**When requesting a CV from Claude:**
```
"Create my CV in TSX format. Please:
- Use standard formatting
- Keep it to 2 pages
- Use common fonts (Arial or similar)
- Include all standard sections (header, experience, education, skills)"
```

**When modifying a CV:**
```
"Update my experience section with [details].
Make sure the TSX code stays valid."
```

**Before converting:**
- ✅ Review the CV content in Claude
- ✅ Make sure all sections are complete
- ✅ Check settings (page size, margins)
- ✅ Test with default settings first
- ✅ Keep CV under 10 pages

---

## Emergency Backup

### If nothing works:

1. **Copy the CV content** (not the code)
   - Just the text from Claude's preview
   - Save in a text file

2. **Use alternative PDF creator**
   - Paste content into Google Docs
   - Format manually
   - Export as PDF

3. **Come back later**
   - Try ResumeWright again in a few hours
   - Issue might be temporary
   - Browser or extension might need update

4. **Report the issue**
   - Helps us improve
   - Others might have same problem
   - We can add fixes

---

## Understanding Retry Behavior

Some errors allow automatic retry:

**Recoverable errors** (can retry):
- ✅ Syntax errors (after Claude fixes)
- ✅ Converter loading issues
- ✅ Temporary system errors
- ✅ Connection problems

**Non-recoverable errors** (need fixes first):
- ❌ Invalid CV structure (ask Claude to regenerate)
- ❌ Content too large (reduce before retry)
- ❌ Permission denied (grant access first)
- ❌ Browser not supported (switch browser)

---

## Success Strategies

### What works well:

1. **Start simple**
   - Basic CV first
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test after each change

2. **Use standard formats**
   - Page size: Letter (US) or A4 (International)
   - Fonts: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman
   - Length: 1-2 pages

3. **Let Claude handle code**
   - Don't edit TSX manually
   - Describe changes in plain English
   - Let Claude update the code

4. **Test before finalizing**
   - Convert to PDF
   - Review carefully
   - Make adjustments
   - Reconvert
